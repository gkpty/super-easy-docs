# Super Easy Forms Documentation

## What is super easy forms?

Its a modular, open source tool that generates serverless web forms (front-end and back-end) in seconds. It leverages [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates to create all of your necessary resources in the AWS cloud including a A Dynamo DB table, an API Gateway endpoint, and a lambda function. It also automatically generates a ready-to-go html *contact form* that you can copy-paste into your site. the tool is fast, easy to use/integrate,  and completely free as all the AWS resources created have a [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). Version 2.0 now features increased usability, security, and flexibility.


## Background

In the last couple of years the introduction of new cloud services for storage, compute, and content delivery have been improving the usability of static websites. These services allow us to build tools which can bypass most of the limitations commonly associated with static websites. One such limitation is adding forms that can process submissions. We built Super Easy Forms because we needed a fast, modular, open source solution to add/update contact forms in all of our static websites. We hope you find it useful.


## New features in version 2.0
- **Updated to node 10.X**
- **Easier installation** Built in commands have been added to further facilitate installation/configuration/setup
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation includes an API method glossary, CLI commands and everything else you need to use/integrate/collaborate with super-easy-forms.
- **Multiple Forms** You can create as many forms as you want within each of your projects.
- **Support for multiple Forms:** Create and monitor as many forms as you want.
- **List/Export your form submissions:** New command that lets you list or export the database table of your form as either JSON or CSV.
- **Reusable methods:** Easily integrate super-easy-forms into your own project or workflow.
- **Local config files:** Allow you to easily monitor and update each of your forms
- **Independent multi CLI:** A separate package ([super-easy-forms-cli](https://github.com/gkpty/super-easy-forms-cli)) with multiple commands that have several options and flags allowing you to create/update/delete any of the components of a form individually or all together.
- [**CloudFormation**](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) **template:** Easily keep track of the multiple AWS resources for each one of your forms. You can also modify the templates directly to customize the resources in your form.
- **Input sanitation:** Uses an AWS API Gateway Model and API validator to insure that the parameters supplied are the correct ones before the call even reaches the lambda function.
- **Support for all html input types:** Check [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) for a list of all the valid html types
- **Support for html select with options:** Add Select lists to your form and supply the options
- **Support for required attributes:** Choose which fields in your form you want to make required
- **Smart labels:** The parser will read your input fields and create labels for you by separating camel cased values and sepparating dashes/underscores and capitalizing first letters. E.g. first_name → First Name or  firstName → First Name
- **Custom email message/subject** you can customize the email message and subject that gets sent when someone submits a form.
- **Optional** [**reCAPTCHA**](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro)**:** Add Google’s ReCaptcha v2 to your contact form to insure that requests are only coming in from a trusted source i.e. your website and that the users submitting it are indeed humans.


# Installation
## Pre-requisites

*  Make sure you have node.js (10.x +) and npm installed. You can checkout this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@lucaskay/install-node-and-npm-using-nvm-in-mac-or-linux-ubuntu-f0c85153e173) to install npm and node in mac, linux (debian/ubuntu).
* Have an AWS account. If you don't have an AWS account, you can easily create one [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?#/start). Don't worry, everything you do with this project will fall within the AWS free tier limit! 

## Installation

1. if you dont have an existing static website project you can create a new directory `mkdir project-name` replacing project-name with the desired name for your project. 
2. Go into your desired project's directory `cd project-name` 
**install super easy forms** `npm install super-easy-forms`
3. **Install the super easy forms CLI globally** `npm install -g super-easy-forms-cli`
4. **Run the build command** Run `$ sef build -r=your-aws-region -p=profile-name` from the root of your project's directory. replace profile-name with the desired name of the IAM user and your-aws-region with the desired AWS region code.
5. Finish creating your IAM user in the AWS Console and hold on to the access keys. If you had already created your IAM user you can ignore this step and close the browser window.
6. **Update the local profile in your machine.** The local profiles are stored in `~/.aws/credentials` in mac/linux or in `C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\credentials` in windows. you can create/edit this file by runing `sudo nano ~/.aws/credentials`. add the profile keys in the format shown bellow.

        [profilename]
        aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
        aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>


# Usage
## Create a serverless form

1. open up the terminal and go to the root of your project `cd your-project-name`
2. run `sef init formname` replace formname with the name you want to give to your new form. For example the domain name followed by paymentform.
3. edit the config file saved in `./forms/formname/config.json` and add values for the variables shown bellow following the same format. captcha, emailMessage and emailSubject are optional. 
4. run `sef fullform formname`

```
{
  "email":"your@email.com",
  "recipients":["recipient1@email.com","recipient2@email.com"],
  "formFields":{
    "fullName":{
      "type":"text",
      "label":"Full Name",
      "required":true
    },
    "email":{
      "type":"email",
      "label":"Email",
      "required":false
    },
    "payment":{
      "type":"select",
      "label":"Payment",
      "required":true,
      "options":{
        "visa":"Visa",
        "master_card":"Master card",
        "cash":"Cash"
      }
    },
    "paymentAmount":{
      "type":"number",
      "label":"Payment Amount",
      "required":true
    }
  },
  "captcha":false,
  "emailSubject":"",
  "emailMessage":"",
}
```

This creates the back-end and fornt-end for a form called formname. the form will have the fields Full Name, Email,Payment method (with options Visa, Master Card, or Cash) and payment amount. Whenever someone submits the form an email will be sent from your@email.com to recipient1@email.com and recipient2@email.com.

Optionally you can provide your desired values directly in the CLI flags without having to edit the config file as shown in the command bellow.

       sef fullform formname --email=your@email.com --fields=fullName=text=required,email=email=required,paymentMethod=select=required=visa/master_card/cash,paymentAmount=number=required --recipients=recipient1@email.com,recipient2@email.com

## Use the API
        const SEF = require('super-easy-forms')

        SEF.CreateForm(formName, options, function(err, data){
                if(err) console.error(err)
                else{
                        //Do Something
                }
        })


## Optional Arguments & Callbacks

All forms will generate a folder for that form within your project. this folder will contain the forms config.json file which keeps track of all of that form’s variables.

All of the super easy form commands make use of optional arguments and optional callbacks. If a required argument isn't supplied to one of the methods that method will check the form's local config file and use the value stored there. if the argument isn't provided in params and isn't found in the form’s config file it will throw an error.

All methods have the `function(formName, options, callback)` format and all  the callbacks have the `function(err,data)` format.

If a callback isn’t provided methods will return the data value or throw an error in the case of an error. If you don’t provide any options you can provide the callback as the second argument.

# Project structure

## Your new Super Easy Forms Project
At the root of the project you will find the forms folder which will contain all of your forms

    |- forms/
        |- yourFrom/
            |- exports/
            |- yourForm.html
            |- config.json
            |- template.json
            |- yourFormFunction.zip
            |- yourFormFunction
                |-index.js
                |node_modules/
    |- .env
    |- .gitignore
    |- settings.json
    |- node_modules
        |- super_easy_forms/
            
## The Config file

A config.json file with all of the form variables is created for each of your forms. 
    {
      "email":"String",
      "emailSubject":"String",
      "emailMessage":"String",
      "recipients":[Array],
      "formFields":{Object},
      "endPointUrl":"String",
      "captcha":true|false,
      "zip": true|false,
      "functionBucket": true|false,
      "stackId":"String",
      "restApiId":"String"
    }

# Components

## The Lambda Function
The CreateLambda method generates the node.js code for the lambda function  and places it in a directory with its reuqired modules. Then it zips the directory and uploads it to an S3 bucket.

1. The lambda function will receive a JSON object with the form output.
2. If you selected the captcha option, it will use axios to send a post request to google’s recaptcha server and verify the response.
3. Then it will format the fields to be stored in dynamoDB and call the dynamoDB putItem method to save the item.
4. If this operation is successful it will send an email message using SES to the desired recipients.


## The CloudFormation Template

AWS CloudFormation is a IaC (Infrastructure as code) service from AWS that allows you to define stacks composed of AWS resources in a JSON or YAML file called a cloudformation template. This makes it easy to keep track of the multiple resources used by each of your forms. The cloudformation template is stored in each form’s directory in the file called template.json.


![Diagram exported from AWS CloudFormation Designer](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_B70B5B93F7E2794EC706951FA6D762D4D2818CCCBBF59F7D45472AC441AABAE2_1576391819245_template1-designer.png)



## The Form Generator

The createForm function takes in a JSON object with the format shown bellow and outputs a responsive HTML form (bootstrap) with an inline JQuery handler. In the config file, you can add labels/placeholders and provide options for things like required fields, different html types and more. The HTML form is completely customizable as its pure HTML; no iframes!

    "formFields":{
        "fullName":{
          "type":"text",
          "label":"Full Name",
          "required":true
        },
        "email":{
          "type":"email",
          "label":"Email",
          "required":false
          },
        "payment":{
          "type":"select",
          "label":"Payment",
          "required":true,
          "options":{
            "visa":"Visa",
            "master_card":"Master card",
            "cash":"Cash"
          }
        },
        "paymentAmount":{
          "type":"number",
          "label":"Payment Amount",
          "required":true
        }
      },

The form and fullform commands in the CLI use the parseFields method which takes in a string in the following format `--fields=fullName=text=required,email=email=required,paymentMethod=select=required=visa/master_card/cash,paymentAmount=number=required` and converts it to a JSON object with the required format be stored in the forms config file and passed to the createForm function. The labels option in the CLI adds human friendly labels to form inputs and to the select options by separating camel-cased characters, replacing underscores and dashes with spaces, and capitalizing first letters.


# Registering emails

 SES is a service from AWS that allows you to send emails programmatically using any email provider. Please be aware that if you want to use AWS SES to send emails to external recipients (whose email addresses haven't been verified with SES in your AWS account) you must [move out of the AWS SES Sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html).  
 
 To verify a new email with AWS SES run `sef email formName your@email.com -n` replacing formName with the name of your form and your@email with the email you want to verify.


# Captcha

Super easy forms allows you to easily integrate google's reCAPTCHA into your html forms. Before being able to use captcha in your forms make sure you have signed up for a reCAPTCHA key pair. [sign up for a reCAPTCHA key pair](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)

Once you have added a key pair for the correct domain of your respective project, add the following variables in your .env file by running `sudo nano .env` or opening the file in your text editor of choice.

    RECAPCTHA_KEY=your_site_key
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_site_secret key

now when you run a command from the CLI make sure to add the —recaptcha flag or -r shortcut. If you are using the API provide the captcha argument of the options param as true. If you are adding CAPTCHA to an already deployed form, make sure to also update your lambda function.

Please be aware that the captcha checkbox will not work unless the request is coming in from the domain you put when requesting your key pair.

# Troubleshooting

If you have modified the super-easy-forms source code and your commands are failing for some reason, you can run the test suite with `npm test`. If this doesnt help you locate your errors youll have to debug your code. 

If your forms arent being submitted you can these steps to troubleshoot:
1. Validate your cloud formation template you can use the template command with the --validate flag or the -v shortcut.
2. Test your lambda function in the AWS console by using the test feature
3. Test your API gateway endpoint in the AWS console by using the test feature.
3. Test the API by using curl `curl -d '{"id":"", "firstName":"john","lastName":"doe", "email":"johndoe@email.com", "message":"hello world"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://your-api-url`
4. Test your API from an external form: insure that CORS is properly enabled in your API
5. generate a form for your API and try submitting. check out the console in google chrome for any errors.
